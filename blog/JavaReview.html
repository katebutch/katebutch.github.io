   <h2>an analogy for JS and its relation to css and html</h2>

    <p>
      Since the last challenge got me thinking so much about cafe food, here's how JS, HTML and CSS is like a Reuben sandwich.
    </p>
    <p>
      You have your core components - bread, cheese, meat, cabbage, spread. CSS style that into Rye bread, swiss cheese, corned beef, sauerkraut, and Russian dressing. This is a good sandwich. But with a JS function of heat, it could be the best experience of your life. When the consumer interacts with it, the elements of the sandwich respond to each other to make a seamless and responsive experience.

   <h2>explaining control flow and loops</h2>
    <p>
      The machine in which we input our code needs a particular structure in which to interpret that code so that it functions according to an order of operations. This is what is referred to by control flow. Loops are a JavaScript component of this,  insofar as they are an element that falls within the control flow, which effects the order of control flow. Loops are an interruption to the machine's interpretation of code. It generically will instruct the machine to run a function or other element again until instructed to stop and complete processing. Or in tech language, it runs until it meets a certain condition.

  <h2>irl example?</h2>
    <p>
      dishes! do the dishes (scrub scrub scrub) until they are (and here's the condition) they are clean!

  <h2>what is DOM? and how does one mess with it?</h2>
    <p>
      When someone refers to a document object model (DOM), they are generally speaking to the structure of an html document. Sometimes this will be xml but we'll focus on html. It is best to think of a tree structure, where we start from html and grow 'branches' from this base which are our core objects and all the little elements within elements. Your DOM might look more shrub-like. That's fine. 
    </p>
    <p>
      DOM defines the 'logical' structure of a document, how a machine accesses and interprets a document. This logic is relatively flexible, just like a tree or shrub. In mastering control-flow, we become experts in bonsai. DOM essentially represents a webpage in a hierarchal manner - this makes it easier for programmers to understand the control flow of the document and search through it. 
    </p>
    <p>
      It is also, and this is the fun part, easy to manipulate. Generally speaking, you can see the DOM of any website by pressing F12, or right clicking anywhere in the viewport and selecting 'inspect'. This will open your browsers' relevant DevTools. Say you are in chrome, chrome DevTools will be available to you. There's an intimidating abundance of tools in here, some of which could be a little risky to the safety of your machine. But, it is certainly easy to see the DOM by opening the 'elements' tool (inspector in firefox). World's your oyster. You can manipulate essentially everything in here. I personally had a spot of fun remixing some tweets, accessing hidden elements and inspecting things that I just wanted to know how they worked. DOM, as viewed through DevTools, is incredibly revealing of all your favourite websites.
      </p>
      <p>
      On top of exploration of other pages, DevTools and DOM are endlessly useful when building your own websites. DOM in tandem with DevTools is excellent for trialling your JavaScript functions, event listeners, loops, the lot. You are able to run your code into the DevTools console (with console.log) to check if it is working at any stage in the flow of your document. DevTools is able to detect any issues when interpreting the document and point them out. You can also build a deeper understanding of how your functions are interacting with APIs, html elements, css elements, the network, etcetera. Overall it's an intimidating yet fabulous tool.

  <h2>what's so different about grabbing data from arrays as opposed to objects?</h2>
    <p>
      Objects and arrays are very similar in logic, but with some significant differences in how they function. The essential thing to know is that arrays use numbered indexes and objects use key object pairs (in other words, named indexes). So this impacts how the data is accessed. 
    </p>
    <p>
      We can store an array inside an object, but we can't store an object inside an array. At least I don't think so.. I can maybe see how you would do it, but certainly not why. 
     </p> 
     <p> 
     We are given options because we have so much data in the world to be stored and handled in a multitude of way. Some data, such as lists or numbers, are better accessed from an array. Other data that needs more specificity, such as client information, is better suited to an object. 
     </p>
  <h2>what are functions? and why are they so wonderful?</h2>
    <p>
      Functions are an essential part of contemporary JavaScript. I think of them as tiny engines. You can put all sorts of different gears, pistons, nuts and bolts into this smaller component to make a larger machine do all sorts of things. When we put these little adorable engines in our code, they communicate from our JavaScript file to our HTML and CSS, and help us manipulate the elements already on our page to function in new and very exiting ways. Beyond communicating between the branches of our DOM, we can use functions to push and pull data from around the web, perform mathematical equations. Responsiveness and network activity is generally speaking the primary way in which JavaScript is used to enhance a users' experience of the web.
    </p>
    <p>
      A function will most commonly have two parts. The initial definition, where all components (or pieces of code) are written into the structure. But this will do very little on its own - in order for a function to 'run', it must be called. Declare and execute, or define and call - this is the basics to how a function appears in our code.
