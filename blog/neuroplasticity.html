        my brain and me
      </h2>

      <p>
        Neuroplasticity is a phenomena where the brain is rewired to function in some way that differs from how it previously functioned.

        I have found reading up on this topic particularly of interest as I have had first hand experience of this brain process going "wrong", or in an undesirable fashion, in myself. Following a concussion, my brain rewired itself to cope with the injury and protect the parts of my brain and spine that were damaged. This resulted in nerves sending strange signals around my arms, neck and back as well as poor balance, constant fight-or-flight response, reduced eyesight, overly sensitive hearing.. List goes on. This hyperreactive nerve process was my brain plasticity rewiring to prevent further injury. However, in my recovery, my brain has been less malleable to efforts towards improvement. Utilising this part of our brain function towards beneficial ends is colloquially recognised as 'growth mindset', and I can speak from experience, it is an exceedingly difficult thing to achieve. One thing this experience did prove to me was that the brain constantly changes and develops growing new connections all the time. If the brain can re-wire to protect itself, it can re-wire to enhance itself.

      <p>
        I think Roald Dahl sums up the nature of 'growth mindset' in The Twits. If one sustains a positive outlook on life, that will radiate from within that person. Such as if one is dedicated and positively reinforces their ability to learn and grow, they make steady progression towards growing and developing their brain.

        Certain practices enhance one's ability to harness neuroplasticity. These are generally cardiovascular exercise, resistance training, slowing of breath, mindfulness. In a bigger picture, any method that allows us to develop greater consciousness of thought and actions that slow our reactive instincts will contribute towards positively harnessing the neuroplasticity in our brains. Practice makes permanent, not necessarily perfect. One should be mindful of habits, thought processes and environmental influences that can have a negative impact on one inwards and outwards perceptions.
