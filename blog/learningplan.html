       <h2>
        What is your long term goal or career pathway?
      </h2> 

            In the next five years I hope to be completing a masters of Fine Arts in Germany. I am doing this course to inform my personal and professional practice, as well as to hold a qualification that makes me employable at any moment in many contexts. A career in arts is not a wholly stable pursuit, on the other hand, a career in web development is the polar opposite. And a career in Web Dev is one that I know I will be able to bring a critical and creative lens to. I see development and tech as tools to build the next world, I look forward to stretching my legs as an artist with a solid foundation in development.

       <h2>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h2>

            My strengths in learning are many. I love to try any and all skills that I have not yet learned. A weakness that tends to stem out of this is a 'jack of all trades, master of none' complex. I know how to DJ, VJ, run and host events, in my expertise at my previous Job I taught all my surrounding team members in the ways of painting and fixings, I can build, I know casting materials, I make music, I know circuitry, I know taxidermy, I've made raspberry pi run animatronic rats, I'm a writer, a poet, a team leader, a drag artist and performer, for years I've been educating others in necessary LGBTQ knowledge and been a support person to many, I'm a critical researcher, a video maker, artist.  I have a passion for learning in itself. There are things I have failed at (too much of a dyke for fashion) and even so, I have learnt more about myself, my capabilities and my limits. My primary strength is my perseverance. I enjoy what I learn because I know how to make it relevant to interests and curiosity for the world around me. A limitation that concerns me is my tendency to overload myself. I consistently sign away my spare time to side projects as well as assign far deeper understanding to any task at hand. I have often overextended myself at times to the detriment of my goals.

       <h2> 
        What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy? 
       </h2>
          I intend on focusing my attention towards patience with myself and with others. I hope to prioritise managing my time in such a way that gives me room to breathe and achieve my goals inside and outside of Enspiral Dev Academy. I hope that this makes me approachable and easy to work alongside. 

       <h2> A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include: </h2>
       <h6>• An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives
            • What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</h6>

          Communication comes to mind immediately. I cannot expect support if no one knows where I'm at. I am committed to managing my time and implementing a personal routine -  exercising to keep my body and mind performing well, sticking to allotted time for working and allowing for breaks, and continuing to write down and work through my personal challenges. When things build up, generally a short dance break or a chat with a friend refreshes my state of mind. When things really build up I like to go for a walk and go through each 'block' one by one. I reassure myself of my strengths and acknowledge my weaknesses. I will make sure to acknowledge my progress, even if it is minimal. 
          I hope to keep a journalling practice as this has immediately shown me when I am starting to feel pressure. The awareness of pressure and stress is not always in the front of my mind, and it can build up to an unhelpful point, I hope to utilise journalling to mitigate this.

       <h2>
        A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
      </h2>
            When I am in need of assistance I am able to contact anyone on our discord server. I will allocate myself a window of time to break down a problem on my own by breaking the problem down into parts and thinking from my experience in foundations to make a judgement about how long I should be spending on it. Past that point I will recognise myself as 'stuck' and promptly contact relevant persons for assistance.

       <h2>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>

           I expect a capacity to understand the tough nature of learning a new skill in a short timeframe. I expect lee-way on deadlines so long as communication has been established. I expect to have my work paid attention to in equal amounts to other students, and for any improvement suggestions to be made. I hope that fascillitators see me as an individual person rather than one student of many. 
       <h2>
        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.         
       </h2>
           As a working DJ I have limited my shows, but I have not omitted important opportunities to perform. I have three certain dates lined up in August, September and October - two in Wellington and one in Auckland. I will need to work at my old place of employment to support myself financially through this course - my rent takes up three quarters of my student allowance and I am anticipating some financial pressure. 
           I have been given an opportunity to produce a piece of writing alongside an exhibition with some friends which is an opportunity I have wanted for a really long time. I am going to be blocking in the time to do this a couple days of the week for only a few hours at a time and this is due in a few months.
