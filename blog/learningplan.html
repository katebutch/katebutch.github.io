       <h4>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h4> 
          In the next five years I hope to be completing a masters of Fine Arts in either The Netherlands or Germany. I am doing this course to inform my personal and professional practice, as well as to hold a qualification that makes me employable at any moment in many contexts. A career in arts is not a wholly stable pursuit, on the other hand, a career in web development is the polar opposite. And a career in Web Dev is one that I know I will be able to bring a critical and creative lens to. I see development and tech as tools to build the next world, I look forward to stretching my legs as an artist with a solid foundation in development.
       <h4>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h4>
            My strengths in learning are many. I love to try any and all skills that I have not yet learned. A weakness that tends to stem out of this is a 'jack of all trades, master of none' complex. I know how to DJ, VJ, run and host events, in my expertise at my previous Job I taught all my surrounding team members in the ways of painting and fixings, I can build, I know casting materials, I make music, I know circuitry, I know taxidermy, I've made raspberry pi run animatronic rats, I'm a writer, a poet, a team leader, a drag artist and performer, for years I've been educating others in necessary LGBTQ knowledge and been a support person to many, I'm a critical researcher, a video maker, artist.  I have a passion for learning in itself. There are things I have failed at (too much of a dyke for fashion) and even so, I have learnt more about myself, my capabilities and my limits. My primary strength is my perseverance. I enjoy what I learn because I know how to make it relevant to interests and curiosity for the world around me. A limitation that concerns me is my tendency to overload myself. I consistently sign away my spare time to side projects as well as assign far deeper understanding to any task at hand. I have often overextended myself at times to the detriment of my goals.
       <h4> What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy? </h4>
              A weakness in myself that has very quickly come to my attention at Dev Academy thus far is my aversion to openness and vulnerability - particularly in asking for help. I much prefer to be the one helping rather than the one helped. I'm a very closed-off person and it takes me time to soften up around others. Overall I hope to put my pride in the back seat and immerse myself in this learning environment where we are all learning alongside one another. 
       <h4> A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include: </h4>
       <h6>• An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives
            • What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</h6>

          Communication comes to mind immediately. I cannot expect support if no one knows where I'm at. I am committed to managing my time and implementing a personal routine -  exercising to keep my body and mind performing well, sticking to allotted time for working and allowing for breaks, and continuing to write down and work through my personal challenges. When things build up, generally a short dance break or a chat with a friend refreshes my state of mind. When things really build up I like to go for a walk and go through each 'block' one by one. I reassure myself of my strengths and acknowledge my weaknesses. I make sure to acknowledge my progress, even if it is minimal. 
       <h4>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h4>
            When I am in need of assistance I am able to contact anyone on our discord server.
        <h4>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h4>
           I expect a capacity to understand the tough nature of learning a new skill in a short timeframe. I expect lee-way on deadlines so long as communication has been established. I expect to have my work paid attention to in equal amounts to other students, and for any improvement suggestions to be made. 
        <h4>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in. </h4>
           As a working DJ I have limited my shows, but I have not omitted important opportunities to perform. I have three certain dates lined up in August and September. I will need to work at my old place of employment to support myself financially through this course - my rent takes up three quarters of my student allowance and I am anticipating some financial pressure. 
            I make time for my friends at least once a week, and my partner more-so.
