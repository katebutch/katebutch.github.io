    <h2> Blocked </h2>

    <p>
      This week was by far the most challenging sprint. I found JS fundamentals very challenging last week and didn't enter sprint 4 with a lot of confidence. I struggled most of all in katas. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Most of my problem solving in this was heavily reliant on googling problems, breaking what I was trying to do into chunks, defining each thing and really trying to get a grip on exactly what I was trying to do. Once I had that I could check if I had all my ducks, then put them in a row. I found it a lot easier to figure out where I went wrong when I had some level of confidence that I knew all the elements I needed. I could follow that with diagnosing my syntax issues. Primarily this came from researching particular elements, but I found a lot of valuable help in the discord from other people going through the same issues. Error messages were also helpful most of the time when they were specific, but I had to have my code fundamentally in-check to receive helpful error messages.
    </p>

    <p>
      How did I feel? Pretty low and defeated for most of the sprint. When I did have breakthroughs I was still second-guessing my abilities and did not feel confident to explain the solution I had come up with.
    </p>

    <p>
      I learned a few things this week. One was straight away in katas - when something is defined you don't have to declare or do anything to the object (like, function.. 'let') to change something about it. You can just say, hey thing, you're this now. I did begin to form an understanding of how to separate out your code and then condense it into an ES6 style of code. For some reason ES6 has seemed much more comfortable to me - maybe because I still feel intimidated by large chunks of code.
    </p>

    <h2> 'elegantly solved a problem' </h2>


    <p>
      I was more relaxed with JS-Gradebook. The first problem I encountered was to think about how to access an array inside of an array and push information into it. I recalled the 'push' method, googled it to make sure my instinct was right and to double check the syntax of how to use a method in code. I broke it down into logical steps using pseudocode and attempted different ways of writing out the code. My first few attempts failed, so I consulted Joseph's video and found that I had used wrong brackets (square for students and score). In this I learned that we use [] for functions that we have declared prior but within an object - so it grabs information from inside an object and () for posing an argument to functions (or in this case, a method) that already exist in the array.
    </p>

    <h2> Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes </h2>
    
    
    
    • Pseudocode

    <p>
      This is becoming a very useful tool for me. I don't feel 100% confident in writing pseudocode, I think I am still messy and disorganised with my thought process which reflects in the use of this skill, however it is helpful in giving me a blueprint to work from.
    </p>

    • Trying something

    <p>
      Don't usually have a lot of luck first time with just planting some code and seeing what happens (as in it never usually works straight away) but in tandem with utilising error messages this does tend to point me in the right diresvtion and is generally a helpful skill.
    </p>

    • Rubber ducky method

    <p>
      Have not used this method.
    </p>

    • Reading error messages

    <p>
      Most of the time this is helpful. Sometiimes the error messages I see are far too cryptic and make no sense, and other times it points me to exactly where I need to alter my code. 
    </p>

    • Console.logging

    <p>
      Not overly confident. Haven't used it much. Will endevour to utilise the console log tool to isolate issues.
    </p>

    • Googling

    <p>
      Old faithful. Very happy to research my questions before asking. 10/10
    </p>

    • Asking your peers for help

    <p>
      This is a last resort for me as I like to give it my best shot in my own time. But when I have asked in discord this has been mostly helpful.
    </p>

    • Asking coaches for help

    <p>
      Falls into the same definition as above.
    </p>

    • Improving your process with reflection

    <p>
      This is probably the most crucial and beneficial part. At any point that I've made the effort to reflect, the lessons I've learned have stuck a lot firmer in my head and I've been able to give myself credit where I didn't feel it was due in the process of problem solving.
