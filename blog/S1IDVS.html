      <h2>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and the consequences of your action. </h2>

      I'd like to answer this with a situation that myself and others endured last year. I had a very mentally unwell friend living in my flat whose behaviour brought a lot of turmoil to myself and the other people I lived with at the time. Thousands of dollars was taken from our bills and rent account, personal items were taken and we were emotionally manipulated to care for this person beyond any normal capacity and pitted against each-other. The situation was generally managed by catering for this person, calling mental health and addiction services when things were beyond our capabilities and communicating with our landlord (who, bless him, was exceptionally understanding). However, this situation grew to be almost entirely unmanageable and I ended up being singled out and mistreated by this person. 
      
      As this had taken place over two years, the exhaustion over this situation had reached an extreme point and we faced an ethical decision of asking this person to leave our home. This was incredibly difficult as we all knew this person had ADHD, anxiety and rapidly declining addiction problems. We weighed up how much support they would have external to the flat and contacted health professionals. We also needed to acknowledge how extreme the situation had become as our initial friendships with this person were sorely damaged and we were all under huge emotional and financial stress. 
      
      We made the decision to talk to them about our feelings in a private setting where they had someone who they trusted to be there. We informed them that we no longer felt that their behaviour was something we were able to cope with and asked this person to leave. We aided in this process of them finding a new place as much as they would allow us. We knew that this persons' health was no longer going to benefit from staying in our home, and we knew that we had all been seriously impacted by the situation and were not able to support them.
      
      This decision was very difficult. The outcome was that they found a new place to stay and we were entirely relieved of the situation as other mutual friends had stepped in to help. This person received help from Te Haika and other mental health services and found a place to live quickly. Unfortunately the friendship we had with this person has all but disappeared. In hindsight, we should have acted much sooner in removing them from the flat as they left at a very low point in their life and resents us for that. However, I know that they are pursuing mental wellbeing and had the time and space to reflect on their behaviour. Importantly, our general wellbeing was made a priority. We were far happier from our decision and we knew that this person was in a safe and stable situation. 
      
        <h2> Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity. </h2>
      
      For me, there are two significant 'cultures' that have influenced my core self. One is my blood - my Dutch ancestry and having grown up in Tamaki Makaurou. The other, is the community of artists and queer people that have been a part of my life for the past five years. 
      
      From my family unit, the Dutch values instilled in me from a young age guide me through the constantly evolving and challenging areas of life I thrust myself into. Pulling at these threads, what comes to mind is the emphasis that has been placed on perseverance, tactfulness, punctuality and honesty. My family has always been a unit to turn to in times of trouble. We are reliable and stick to our word. Knowing the value of being trusted has been made abundantly clear to me. Trust is sacred, I never take someone's trust in me lightly nor do I pass out my own freely. I prefer a sense of good faith in others to be what I offer freely. When trust is built over time, it does not shake in the wind. Perseverance is huge for me, I see things through to their limit and I keep my intentions clear and honest.
      
      The community I have grown alongside over the past few years has made my skin thicker and my light brighter. I am emboldened and self assured from going through phases of my life with those I call my closest friends. My friends can be harsh and scrutinising, but only because we seek nothing less of full effort and constant refinement from ourselves and each-other. 
      
      I don't feel my identity is influenced so greatly by external forces, only insofar as my principles and core values are held up strong inside me. My identity needs little emphasis. I know exactly who I am because of my integrity to these core values. There are only times of crisis in my life when I have been insincere to the promises I make to myself and how I handle what is thrown at me - never that which is thrown. 
      
      
      <h2>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development // Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they intersect with learning obstacles</h2>
        
      I am strong in learning as I am quick to figure out what works for me, I know what I bring to different contexts and where I can lean into my points of insight. I am passionate, which brings strength as well as weakness to my learning. I'd much sooner not hand over my work on a deadline than hand in something that is not my best and fullest effort. My learning generally takes a hit when I am intimidated. I am not much of an open book and do not find myself comfortable in scenarios where my weaknesses and failures are open for others to see and be impacted by. I do feel very hesitant to ask for help in every aspect of my life and when I do I prefer it from those who I have built a trusting relationship with. This is not so helpful in my current environment and it is a huge challenge for me. So far, my excitement for this course has helped me move past that uncomfortability and I hope to continue with being open and vulnerable.
      
      
      <h2>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h2>
      
      I have participated in many exhibitions, some over time have been challenging for interpersonal reasons. On one occasion I worked in a team of six artists, one in particular being a close friend who is notoriously difficult to work with. Knowing this persons working style and habits, I communicated clearly with this person what my expectations were for their participation and made my availability to help clear from the beginning. After some time, deadlines had not been met and we were a week out from the exhibition with very little input from this artist and no indication of what they were wanting to show or contribute. Communication was maintained throughout the project but only empty promises had been made with nothing to show for it. 
      Conceptual and structural groundwork was continued without them for lack of their participation, as the key organiser in this exhibition it was my responsibility to resolve the situation with this artist. I was faced with several options - one was to exclude the artist from showing and preserve my energy for my own work. Another solution was to wait until the artist had something to show, which as predicted was only 24 hours prior to the opening of the show, and let them place their work in a room full of carefully considered installation pieces where it would be seen as an afterthought - this would seriously detract from their work and the work of every other artist in the exhibition. The third solution was by far the most time consuming, but the solution that I went for. This was to continue to communicate with the artist, set clear parameters (time/duration of the work, size, location in the space) and craft room around these parameters. This was risky as if they fell through on their promise then I would have been left with dead space in a room full of work that had taken hours to install and a gap in a media script that ran daisy-chained projectors, speakers and lights. 
      
      It is common in team work scenarios for there to be one or more members that do not pull their weight. I maintained communication with this person the entire project and offered my assistance from tech, building, sourcing materials to life management support. This strategy of anticipating their lack of participation and extending my assistance and clearly communicating the progression of the project was successful  insofar as I had taken the time to understand and honour their work and made room for them in the space. They were not entirely happy with the outcome, but that frustration was primarily over their own negligence. The solution was the best possible for them considering the situation. What was unsuccessful was the extra effort I had put into supporting them compromised my own work. I ran out of time to complete a technical detail in what I had constructed and my work was not displayed as I had hoped. 
      I do not wish to indulge the hindsight of this situation. What I do take from this situation is an awareness of how I feel a responsibility over others and I hate to see people fail. This impacted my ability to succeed in honouring my own work with the time and extra effort it needed to push it over that last line. What I understand from this is a sense of self-responsibility. I see far clearer now where I should be helping others, and where the limit is on how much I can do for someone.
