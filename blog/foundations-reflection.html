      <h2>
        are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?
      </h2>
      <p>
      This is the first learning environment I have been in since my head injury late last year. I was surprised and upset to find that my patience and perseverance in learning had taken a hit. I'm far more short fused than I used to be. I learnt a lot from the neuroplasticity research aspect of core. 
      </p>
      <p>
      I have a very real fear of failure. I found myself in absolute distress at a few points in foundations and saying some pretty cruel things to myself. It's not necessarily 'new' to me, but rather something I thought that I had under control which I evidently did not. I have made an active effort to find the patience and forgiveness towards myself when I don't understand things straight away.
      </p>
      <p>
      I have discovered I have an incredibly hectic way of learning. An everything, everywhere, all at once approach. I've always been this way, but I really have been confronted with how debilitating this style of learning can be when approaching problems that need to be solved methodically and logically. Not saying I'm innately illogical, I don't hate myself that much, it's more like electricity in a circuit. It doesn't actually 'flow', we just talk about it that way. It actually goes everywhere and is a non-linear system. I'm wanting to work with this part of myself, rather than against it. I've always been big-picture first, systems second. It's the follow-through I feel I need to work on.
      </p>
      <h2>
      What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?
      </h2>
      <p>
      'Role of values' is broad. My particular values will not be uniform with all others. So I'll assume this is asking me the importance of knowing my personal values. Knowing this means knowing what to pursue and how to pursue it in a working and collaborative environment. For me it means to hold an honourable conduct when working alongside others. Which leads me into empathy and self-awareness. No two people are the same. We are made up of private worlds tha we may or may not wish to share. The important component of this is empathy. Knowing that people react or respond in particular ways due to what is written into their historical blanket. Empathy is crucial to fostering an environment where  people feel safe to learn. Feeling as though one can continue to learn in a professional context means opening opportunities for new ideas and new methods. This directly ties into a 'growth' mentality. If one has empathy for one's self and towards others, we can accept the dynamic personal features at play in ourselves and others and rather than that get in the way of progress, empathy can help our personal backgrounds feed into productivity. Empathy is important outside of professional productivity, but we are talking in the context of an industry. Ultimately self-awareness is useful to employ for the sake of kind conduct and sincere intentions.

      <h2>
      What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
      </h2>
      <p>
      Neuroplasticity was absolutely the most enjoyable to research. I found it immediately relevant to my situation and the research I sought was honest and helpful. This really helped me make sense of my limitations and move past them. I guess I was surprised to find something so helpful and close to home.
      </p>

      <h2>
      What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
      </h2>
      <p>
      I'm never particularly excited to be open with others about how I see myself, even in private scenarios. This has forced me to learn how to communicate my personal journey in mental growth which is something I find very invasive. I'm not keen on showing nor declaring personal weaknesses in public. Being a queer and considering the environment I grew up in, I do not find it 'safe' to let my guard down. I'm all for the openness of others but I do not generally allow that for myself. Allowing myself to be vulnerable has been a sure-fire way to get hurt or to hurt others, so I reserve that for people I trust and know well.  So having to be emotionally open alongside a course in something that I have struggled with for years was very challenging for me.
      </p>
      <h2>
      Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
      </h2>
      <p>
      The future of tech is something that every single person will interact with and ultimately rely on to some extent. It already has a huge influence over humanity - see the political and radicalising effects of facebook in non-western countries. I make sense of Dev Academy's emphasis on 'core' to be an attempt at teaching programmers/developers to place themselves within the context of what they are making. 
      </p>
      <p>
      On a practical note, I think the focus on core, putting one's ego on the back-seat, is to emphasise the innately collaborative and open-source methods of tech. What I admire the most about tech is open-source projects. Tech is a powerful tool because it handles information. In contemporary politics it is important to identify the power that information and information technology has, and especially to evaluate and be critical of one's position within that. Beginning that process is to take one's emotional responses to learning and evaluate our personal contexts. Once we can position ourselves within the context of actively affecting others and being affected by the work that we do, we can move forward into crucial questions about the tech industry and work compassionately and productively with others.

      <h2>
      Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
      </h2>
      <p>
      I did struggle with it and wasted a lot of time being unwilling to share my personal journey in learning. However I always think that writing and communicating is an essential part of establishing our understanding of that which we attempt to learn. I feel like I did waste time, but I don't feel that the core component of DevA was a waste of time. My struggle with it was how open it had to be, which was a significant block in the road for me.
