   <p>Emotional intelligence is a trained insight into the metaphysical networks that connect us to ourselves, to others and to the world through the heart lens. IQ, or intelligence quotient, is more widely known and aspired to. It encompasses logic and strategy, the ability to grasp at the abstract, and understand language systems. Emotional intelligence is a step towards discovering the interconnectedness of our minds and bodies. Our minds and guts are immediately impacted by our emotions, ever been upset and developed a sore stomach? That is a physical element of the emotional landscape. Emotional intelligence is the ability to recognise and respond, rather than react, to the mind, heart and body processing external factors. Gut feeling and intuition is a type of emotional intelligence that many rely on to navigate the world.
    The interconnectedness of IQ, EQ and our bodies is the first hurdle to understand when beginning to develop any one of these areas. It's like when you have a headache and you are advised to stretch and exercise your hips. Sometimes developing where we are struggling the most means thinking away from the issue and learning where the connections that lead to your issue have grown weak.     </p>
  
   <p>The crux of developing emotional intelligence is attention.  It is widely practiced to develop this through mindfulness exercises. The art of being still and impervious to external forces is a self-regulatory practice.</p>
  <p>When one begins to master emotional intelligence, impulses begin to be dampened. The ability to withstand impulses looks like many things. Such as not giving in to temptation when the IQ can identify that that which is desired is not in one's best interests. It also looks like a person capable of being told news or opinions that are intensely unpleasant without overt reaction. One trains ones mind to be patient and to seek less gratification. 
  </p>
  <p>Slowing reactions and impulses through attentive exercises is immediately relevant to the relationships we develop with each other. If you can identify emotional reactions within yourself, you are able to see clearer those responses in others. Insight into the worlds of others comes from within. </p>
